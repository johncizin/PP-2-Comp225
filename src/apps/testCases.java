 You must write 12 test cases:
three for the enqueue
three for the dequeue
two each for the isEmpty, isFull, and toString operations
Each test case will state which operation is to be performed and the state of the test queue prior to the execution of the operation. For the enqueue and dequeue, the test case will state the expected state of the queue after the operation is executed. For all operations other than the enqueue, the test case will state the expected return value.
